        text: "I gave him life twice - once at birth, once with my kidney. When doctors said 'impossible,' I said 'watch him.' When he chose the sky over safety, I understood. Some souls are born to rewrite the rules.\n\nSyam doesn't just survive - he transforms every limitation into a launchpad. At age 8, facing amputation, he asked me 'Will I still be special?' Today, at 13,000 feet, the world has its answer."

Today he flies at 13,000 feet.\n\nThat boy taught me that healing isn't about fixing bodies - it's about unleashing spirits that refuse to be contained. His medical file reads like a war journal. His achievements read like poetry."

        text : "Training Syam redefined my understanding of 'impossible.' Watching him master asymmetric flight, land with precision using core strength alone, then ask for more challenging jumps - this isn't just skydiving.\n\nThis is human evolution in real-time. He doesn't adapt to the sky; the sky adapts to him. His 13,000ft record wasn't just a jump - it was a declaration that gravity has no authority over the human spirit."

We're not just building equipment - we're creating technology that proves human potential has no ceiling.\n\nHis mission will change how the world sees adaptive sports forever. When he exits at 43,000 feet, he carries every 'impossible' dream with him."

From hospital bed to terminal velocity - this is what human courage looks like."

His requirements aren't just specifications - they're blueprints for the future of adaptive human enhancement.\n\nEvery sensor, every neural interface we design carries the weight of his dreams. We're not just building a prosthetic - we're engineering proof that the human spirit has no physical limits."
